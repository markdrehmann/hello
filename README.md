# hello
First repository, learning to use GitHub

Hello world? Why you might be looking at this page, I do not know, but this is me learning how to use GitHub - creating a new branch, making a commit(?), doing it all. In ten years I will look back at this and chuckle to myself.

This is two years later. I'm still novice, but I have come a long long way! I followed random instructions to make this original repo, not knowing at all what a repo was. I'm still new to everything, but what a difference a couple years makes...
